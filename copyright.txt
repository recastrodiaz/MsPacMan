This code is an implementation of "Ms Pac-Man" for the "Ms Pac-Man vs Ghosts Competition".
This competition is organised by Philipp Rohlfshagen, David Robles and Simon Lucas of the University 
of Essex.

The code is written by Philipp Rohlfshagen based on earlier implementations of the game by Simon Lucas 
and David Robles. We would like to thanks all those who help us to improve the code: many participants 
have been active on the forum. Some have volunteered for beta testing, including Daryl Tose (Memetix) 
whose help has been tremendous.
